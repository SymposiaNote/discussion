## Symposia Note

Users expect privacy when they interact with a cloud service provider. There are three fundamental expectations:

  - **Expectation 1**: The cloud service will ask explicit permission before sharing data with other users or companies.
  - **Expectation 2**: The cloud service will implement reasonable safeguards against criminal efforts to steal data.
  - **Expectation 3**: The cloud service will comply with court orders for user data.


Recent news about the National Security Agency's data collection programs has called Expection 3 into question. It is no longer clear that the government is exercising due process when it is demanding data from cloud service providers.

Cloud providers generally want what's best for their users, that is, their primary mission is to add value for their users, not supply data to law enforcement. However, most services store user data un-encrypted, where it is vulnerable to an over-reaching government order.

While it is not reasonable to expect cloud services to refuse to comply with government orders, it is reasonable to expect cloud services to offer their users the *option* of cryptographic privacy, so that any data furnished to the government would be protected by encryption.

While NSA's ability to defeat modern encryption is not known, their ability to read un-encrypted data *is* known, and can therefore be hedged against.

**The goal of Symposia Note is to help cloud services offer their users the option of cryptographic privacy.**
